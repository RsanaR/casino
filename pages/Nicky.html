<p class="para">Nicky Santoro, a mob enforcer, is sent by the mob bosses to assist Ace in Las Vegas. After doing well he becomes overconfident causing his already aggressive and obnoxious behavior to become more intense. He ends up double-crossing everyone around him by cheating on his wife with Ginger and creates a mess for everyone in Las Vegas. He becomes so untrustworthy that eventually the mob bosses reach their limit and have him killed. His deceitful behavior was the main reason that led him to his death.
<br><br>Lesson: Betraying people isnâ€™t the way to be successful in life and it can only get you into trouble.
