<p class="para">Sam 'Ace' Rothstein is a sports handicapper who is sent to oversee a mob-run casino by the mob bosses. At first, he is successful but that quickly changes when he marries a woman under the condition that he will provide her with a luxurious lifestyle. His controlling behavior towards her causes her to resent him and she begins plotting against him. Aceâ€™s best friend turns into his rival in the city and ends up ruining his reputation, causing him to lose his position at the casino. He becomes controlling towards everyone, but in the end, he lost his friend and the woman he loved only to end up back as a sports handicapper.
<br><br>Lesson: Trying to control others will harm you and others around you. You cannot control others as in the end you yourself will lose all relations.
